        <h1>Physiology</h1>

        <p>Rayquaza is a long green serpentine Pokémon with yellow eyes. It has pink lining on the mouth.
            It has yellow, linked, circular markings on its entire body.
            In Mega form, it has a Delta-shaped jaw on its mouth and an elongated serpent body.
            As Mega Rayquaza, it is more aggressive and powerful.</p>

        <p>As a natural ability, Rayquaza can float and control the speed, direction and altitude of it's levitation.
            Despite not having used any of these characteristics in battle throughout its appearances in the anime,
            ll the Rayquazas have very sharp claws on the hands, very sharp teeth and a very powerful constrictor body.
            It's not known if Mega Rayquaza can use its energy whips/tentacles as weapons or regular body members.
            Naturally, given it can travel through the ozone layer safely and even higher layers of Earth's atmosphere,
            it demands very little air to live and possibly none. If none, it could possibly travel through space, since
            the layer that intermediates the Ozone layer and the troposphere can hit -60 °C or -76 F. If the belief that
            Rayquaza
            is responsible for destroying meteors still in the higher atmospheric layers is true, it would have to be
            able to
            endure temperatures that can reach -100 °C, or even -148 F. It shows that Rayquaza have an great resistance
            to cold,
            which is ironic since it has double weakness to the Ice-typing. Despite its resistance, it is not known if
            Rayquaza
            can endure the -270 °C or -454 F of an absolute space vacuum.</p>

        <p>Due to its nature of absorbing the ozone layer particles, if Rayquaza is at Alola region, it is a direct
            predator of
            Minior, should the latter Pokémon died in its core form at limited time and had its particles become one
            with the universe
            for Rayquaza to feed.</p>
