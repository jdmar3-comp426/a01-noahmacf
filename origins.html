        <p>Rayquaza is the most fascinating Legendary Pokemon ever created. Its origins are so vast and varied that
            it’s no wonder it has become one of the most popular ‘mons Game Freak has designed to date. For example,
            when Mega Evolution was introduced in Generation 6, Rayquaza became the only Pokemon who didn’t need a
            Mega Stone to Mega Evolve. Instead, it has a unique organ that allows it to channel consumed asteroids
            into Mega Energy. This is called the “mikado organ,” with “mikado” meaning “emperor” and referring to the
            Emperor of Japan, who is also called “Tenno,” which is translated as the more specific “heavenly emperor.”
            Given Rayquaza’s location at the top of the Sky Pillar and association with space, this makes perfect sense.
        </p>

        <p>But this just refers to Rayquaza’s hierarchical position - it doesn’t explain the full etymological basis for
            it.
            According to Bulbapedia, Rayquaza’s name could refer to “Raqiya,” which is the Hebrew word for “firmament.”
            The
            etymology section here also offers some other alternatives, but given the existence of the mikado organ, the
            most
            likely origin is “retsu ku za,” which combines the Japanese words for “furious,” “sky,” and “seat,” which
            gives us
            “one who sits in the ferocious heavens.” This, clearly, is linked to the “heavenly emperor” connection
            described
            above.</p>

        <p>In terms of Rayquaza’s mythological inspirations, the possibilities are fairly endless. It bears a
            resemblance to
            the vast majority of dragons throughout various cultural mythologies, which makes tracking down a concrete
            origin
            more difficult than with the Legendary titans. What I will say is that the page linked above lists a few of
            the
            more popular examples, some of which hold little to no weight. For example, while the Aztec deity
            Quetzlcoatl was
            a flying snake, it had feathers and was not the leader of its respective circle. It also had a twin, which
            means
            that Rayquaza’s lack thereof makes establishing connections difficult. In general, deific twinning is an
            exercise
            used to highlight opposites - the simple fact that Rayquaza already presides over twin Legendaries makes
            comparisons
            to Quetzlcoatl weak or null by default.</p>

        <p>Rayquaza is far more likely to be based on Japanese dragons, which is backed up by the existence of its
            mikado organ
            and the supporting etymological possibility of its name being derived from “retsu ku za.” As noted in the
            wiki linked
            above, Japanese dragons also notably have three claws, while Chinese dragons have four, giving us a clearer
            idea of
            where Rayquaza’s aesthetic was drawn from. On top of that, if you consult a list of renowned Japanese
            dragons, you’ll
            find that many of them preside over the oceans in a similar way to Rayquaza, and are often connected to
            Emperors in
            accordance with Rayquaza’s name origin.</p>
